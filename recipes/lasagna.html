    <p>
        <strong>Lasagna</strong> is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made by layering flat lasagna noodles with rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan. The layers are assembled and baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly, creating a hearty, comforting meal. Its flavors are a perfect blend of savory tomato sauce, seasoned meat, and creamy cheeses, making it a popular family favorite.
