        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Steaks:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Take the steaks out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pat them dry with a paper towel, then season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Heat the Pan:</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>Add olive oil to the pan and let it heat for a few seconds.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

            <ul>
                <li>Place the steaks in the hot pan and sear for 2-3 minutes without moving them. Flip the steaks and sear for another 2-3 minutes on the other side (for medium-rare).</li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Tilt the pan slightly to pool the melted butter and use a spoon to baste the steaks with the butter-garlic-herb mixture for about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

                <li>Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest on a plate for 5 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong>
